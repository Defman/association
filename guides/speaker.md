# Speaker
The job of the speaker is to lead the meeting and make sure everyone is heard and that we don't speak at the same time.

You will be given speaking permission in the discord channel and you control who else has permission to speak at any given time. There will be a text channel where members can request permission to speak.

You are also in charge of manage voting doing resolutions.
